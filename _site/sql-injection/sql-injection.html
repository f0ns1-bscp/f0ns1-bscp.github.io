<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>SQL injection (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. 
This can allow an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve. 
This might include data that belongs to other users, or any other data that the application can access. 
In many cases, an attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent changes to the application's content or behavior.

In some situations, an attacker can escalate a SQL injection attack to compromise the underlying server or other back-end infrastructure. 
It can also enable them to perform denial-of-service attacks.
</code></pre></div></div>
<h4 id="impact">Impact:</h4>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>A successful SQL injection attack can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as:

Passwords.
Credit card details.
Personal user information.
SQL injection attacks have been used in many high-profile data breaches over the years. 
These have caused reputational damage and regulatory fines. 
In some cases, an attacker can obtain a persistent backdoor into an organization's systems, leading to a long-term compromise that can go unnoticed for an extended period.
</code></pre></div></div>
<h4 id="detect">Detect:</h4>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>You can detect SQL injection manually using a systematic set of tests against every entry point in the application. To do this, you would typically submit:

The single quote character ' and look for errors or other anomalies.
Some SQL-specific syntax that evaluates to the base (original) value of the entry point, and to a different value, and look for systematic differences in the application responses.
Boolean conditions such as OR 1=1 and OR 1=2, and look for differences in the application's responses.
Payloads designed to trigger time delays when executed within a SQL query, and look for differences in the time taken to respond.
OAST payloads designed to trigger an out-of-band network interaction when executed within a SQL query, and monitor any resulting interactions.
Alternatively, you can find the majority of SQL injection vulnerabilities quickly and reliably using Burp Scanner.
</code></pre></div></div>
<h4 id="injection-in-different-part-of-queries">Injection in different part of queries</h4>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Most SQL injection vulnerabilities occur within the WHERE clause of a SELECT query. Most experienced testers are familiar with this type of SQL injection.

However, SQL injection vulnerabilities can occur at any location within the query, and within different query types. Some other common locations where SQL injection arises are:

In UPDATE statements, within the updated values or the WHERE clause.
In INSERT statements, within the inserted values.
In SELECT statements, within the table or column name.
In SELECT statements, within the ORDER BY clause.
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="injection-examples">Injection examples</h4>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>There are lots of SQL injection vulnerabilities, attacks, and techniques, that occur in different situations. Some common SQL injection examples include:

Retrieving hidden data, where you can modify a SQL query to return additional results.
Subverting application logic, where you can change a query to interfere with the application's logic.
UNION attacks, where you can retrieve data from different database tables.
Blind SQL injection, where the results of a query you control are not returned in the application's responses.
</code></pre></div></div>
<h5 id="retrieving-hidden-data">Retrieving hidden data</h5>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Imagine a shopping application that displays products in different categories. When the user clicks on the Gifts category, their browser requests the URL:

https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts
This causes the application to make a SQL query to retrieve details of the relevant products from the database:

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
This SQL query asks the database to return:

all details (*)
from the products table
where the category is Gifts
and released is 1.
The restriction released = 1 is being used to hide products that are not released. We could assume for unreleased products, released = 0.

The application doesn't implement any defenses against SQL injection attacks. This means an attacker can construct the following attack, for example:

https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'--
This results in the SQL query:

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'--' AND released = 1
Crucially, note that -- is a comment indicator in SQL. This means that the rest of the query is interpreted as a comment, effectively removing it. In this example, this means the query no longer includes AND released = 1. As a result, all products are displayed, including those that are not yet released.

You can use a similar attack to cause the application to display all the products in any category, including categories that they don't know about:

https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'+OR+1=1--
This results in the SQL query:

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' OR 1=1--' AND released = 1
The modified query returns all items where either the category is Gifts, or 1 is equal to 1. As 1=1 is always true, the query returns all items.
</code></pre></div></div>

<h5 id="subverting-application-logic">Subverting application logic</h5>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Imagine an application that lets users log in with a username and password. If a user submits the username wiener and the password bluecheese, the application checks the credentials by performing the following SQL query:

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'wiener' AND password = 'bluecheese'
If the query returns the details of a user, then the login is successful. Otherwise, it is rejected.

In this case, an attacker can log in as any user without the need for a password. They can do this using the SQL comment sequence -- to remove the password check from the WHERE clause of the query. For example, submitting the username administrator'-- and a blank password results in the following query:

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = ''
This query returns the user whose username is administrator and successfully logs the attacker in as that user.
</code></pre></div></div>

<h5 id="union-attacks">UNION attacks</h5>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>When an application is vulnerable to SQL injection, and the results of the query are returned within the application's responses, you can use the UNION keyword to retrieve data from other tables within the database. This is commonly known as a SQL injection UNION attack.

The UNION keyword enables you to execute one or more additional SELECT queries and append the results to the original query. For example:

SELECT a, b FROM table1 UNION SELECT c, d FROM table2
This SQL query returns a single result set with two columns, containing values from columns a and b in table1 and columns c and d in table2.

For a UNION query to work, two key requirements must be met:

The individual queries must return the same number of columns.
The data types in each column must be compatible between the individual queries.
To carry out a SQL injection UNION attack, make sure that your attack meets these two requirements. This normally involves finding out:

How many columns are being returned from the original query.
Which columns returned from the original query are of a suitable data type to hold the results from the injected query.
</code></pre></div></div>

<h5 id="blind-sql">Blind SQL</h5>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Many instances of SQL injection are blind vulnerabilities. This means that the application does not return the results of the SQL query or the details of any database errors within its responses. 
Blind vulnerabilities can still be exploited to access unauthorized data, but the techniques involved are generally more complicated and difficult to perform.

The following techniques can be used to exploit blind SQL injection vulnerabilities, depending on the nature of the vulnerability and the database involved:

You can change the logic of the query to trigger a detectable difference in the application's response depending on the truth of a single condition. 
This might involve injecting a new condition into some Boolean logic, or conditionally triggering an error such as a divide-by-zero.
You can conditionally trigger a time delay in the processing of the query. This enables you to infer the truth of the condition based on the time that the application takes to respond.
You can trigger an out-of-band network interaction, using OAST techniques. This technique is extremely powerful and works in situations where the other techniques do not. Often, you can directly exfiltrate data via the out-of-band channel. 
For example, you can place the data into a DNS lookup for a domain that you control.
